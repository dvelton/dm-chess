# Slack-friendly Chess Game PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: To provide a lightweight, ASCII-based chess game that can be easily shared and played within Slack DMs without requiring authentication or external data flows.
- **Success Indicators**: Players can complete full chess games by sharing text-based board representations via copy/paste in Slack conversations.
- **Experience Qualities**: Accessible, Lightweight, Intuitive

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (state management for chess game with simple UI)
- **Primary User Activity**: Acting (making chess moves) and Interacting (with an opponent)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Users want to play chess with colleagues in Slack without external apps or authentication.
- **User Context**: Users will engage during work breaks or casual conversations in Slack, needing to quickly share game states through text.
- **Critical Path**: View board → Make move → Generate shareable ASCII representation → Share → Opponent loads state → Repeat
- **Key Moments**:
  1. Converting between visual board and shareable text representation
  2. Validating chess moves according to standard rules
  3. Providing clear indication of game state (check, checkmate, etc.)

## Essential Features
1. **Interactive Chess Board**
   - What: Visual chess board with draggable pieces
   - Why: Provides intuitive interface for move planning
   - Success: Players can make legal moves and see the result visually

2. **ASCII Board Representation**
   - What: Text-based version of the current board state
   - Why: Allows for easy sharing in Slack without images
   - Success: Board state can be accurately copied, shared, and reconstructed

3. **Import/Export Game State**
   - What: Convert between visual board and ASCII representation
   - Why: Enables game continuation across Slack messages
   - Success: Games can be continued from any point without data loss

4. **Move Validation**
   - What: Enforce standard chess rules
   - Why: Ensures game integrity
   - Success: Only legal moves are permitted

5. **Game State Tracking**
   - What: Track check, checkmate, and draw conditions
   - Why: Provides game progression feedback
   - Success: Players are notified of significant game state changes

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Focused, clean, classic
- **Design Personality**: Elegant with a touch of playfulness
- **Visual Metaphors**: Traditional chess board and pieces with modern UI elements
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface to emphasize the game board

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Classic chess color scheme with modern accents
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (#1e3a8a) for a professional feel
- **Secondary Colors**: Light neutral tones for contrast and readability
- **Accent Color**: Gold/amber (#f59e0b) for highlighting selected pieces and possible moves
- **Color Psychology**: Blue conveys trust and stability, gold adds premium quality
- **Color Accessibility**: High contrast between pieces and board for readability
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (#f8fafc) with foreground (#0f172a) - WCAG AA 16:1
  - Card (#ffffff) with foreground (#0f172a) - WCAG AA 21:1
  - Primary (#1e3a8a) with primary-foreground (#ffffff) - WCAG AA 9:1
  - Secondary (#f1f5f9) with secondary-foreground (#0f172a) - WCAG AA 14:1
  - Accent (#f59e0b) with accent-foreground (#000000) - WCAG AA 10:1
  - Muted (#f1f5f9) with muted-foreground (#64748b) - WCAG AA 4.5:1

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family with varying weights for different elements
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between game information and controls
- **Font Personality**: Clean, legible, slightly traditional
- **Readability Focus**: Monospace font for ASCII representation to maintain alignment
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent use of font weights to indicate importance
- **Which fonts**: 'Roboto' for UI elements, 'Roboto Mono' for ASCII representation
- **Legibility Check**: Both fonts are highly legible at various sizes and weights

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Board is central focus, controls and state information secondary
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing around board and between control groups
- **Grid System**: Simple two-column layout on desktop, stacked on mobile
- **Responsive Approach**: Board scales with viewport, controls reorganize on smaller screens
- **Content Density**: Focused on the chess board with minimal surrounding elements

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations for piece movement and state transitions
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary animation for chess moves, secondary for UI feedback
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Restrained animations that don't distract from gameplay

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for board and controls, buttons for actions, dialog for game status
- **Component Customization**: Subtle shadows and borders for separation of concerns
- **Component States**: Clear hover and active states for interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Chess-themed icons where appropriate, standard UI icons elsewhere
- **Component Hierarchy**: Board (primary), controls (secondary), information (tertiary)
- **Spacing System**: Consistent spacing using Tailwind's scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Vertical stacking of components with appropriately sized touch targets

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based with consistent styling
- **Style Guide Elements**: Typography, colors, spacing, and component styles
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent padding and margins throughout
- **Brand Alignment**: Chess-inspired aesthetic that feels professional and engaging

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and interactive elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for moves and controls
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper labels and ARIA attributes

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Complex chess rules (en passant, castling, promotion)
- **Edge Case Handling**: Clear visual indicators for special moves
- **Technical Constraints**: ASCII representation limitations for complex states

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Potential for game history tracking
- **Testing Focus**: Verify all chess rules are correctly implemented
- **Critical Questions**: How to handle game continuation if ASCII is accidentally modified?

## Reflection
- This approach uniquely balances visual appeal with practical text-based sharing
- We've assumed users have basic chess knowledge - should consider adding help
- Adding minimal animations for piece movement would make the experience exceptional
